NOTES


This dataset includes N=12 partial interviews that are counted as completed interviews. 
A partial interview is considered to be completed if questions are answered through Q59.

Questionnaire and topline reflect questions presented in web mode. CATI mode questionnaire available upon request. 
The CATI version of the questionnaire was shortered so it could be asked over the phone. Many of the reports that use
this dataset are based on web-using adults.    

Support for this project was provided by The Pew Charitable Trusts.


****


This survey was the first survey of the American Trends Panel. Panelists were recruited to participate in the American 
Trends Panel after completing Pew Research Center RDD telephone surveys conducted Jan-March 2014 (see the link to the June
12, 2014 report above for full details on those surveys).

This dataset includes a measure of "ideological consistency" based on 10 questions that were asked on the Jan-March 2014 surveys.
There are two variables:

ideoConsist, which computes an additive scale of these 10 variables (its values range from -10 to +10). 
This variable is used to compute the mean scores of audiences in the October 2014 report. 

F_ideoconsistrec_typology recodes the above variable into 5 categories that are used throughout the reports 
(i.e., consistenly liberal, mostly liberal, mixed, mostly conservative, consistently conservative)

If you are interested in the ideological consistency measures on the general population (or for anything not directly 
relating to the media and information measures in this W1 dataset), please use the dataset associated with the June 2014 report.

The readme file for the June 2014 report contains syntax for how these measures are computed (and that dataset includes the 
10 component variables).
