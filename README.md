# EE461P_political_polarization-analysis
An attempt to find whether consumption of certain forms of media is a predictor of political views from now compared to then

# Steps
Current goal is to isolate columns and see which columns heavily correlate with party. Do certain viewership of media impact political party? By how much? Can we map consumption of certain types of media to certain political parties.

Next is to find other data from different time periods to see if those same factors still heavily influence ML. Additional info needed


We are defining polarization as ideological consistency. In this case, whether Democrats are more consistently liberal and Republicans are consistently conservative
See following article. We use the questions provided as a measure of ideological consistency. https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/section-1-growing-ideological-consistency/

Ideally, if our model accurately predicts that, with certain features, the political party more accurately than previous years, then media is definitely a driving force behind views
