# EE461P_political_polarization-analysis
An attempt to find features that heavily correlate with increased party polarization in the US

# Steps
Current goal is to isolate columns and see which columns heavily correlate with party. Do certain balances in features predict party affiliation and views of other party?
Next is to find other data from different time periods to see if those same factors still heavily influence ML
