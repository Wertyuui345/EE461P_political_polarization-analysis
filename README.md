# EE461P_political_polarization-analysis
An attempt to find features that heavily correlate with increased party polarization in the US

# Steps
Current goal is to isolate columns and see which columns heavily correlate with party. Do certain viewership of media impact political party? By how much? Can we map consumption of certain types of media to certain political parties.

Next is to find other data from different time periods to see if those same factors still heavily influence ML. Additional info needed
